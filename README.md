# TreeForce

This is the github repository for the Tree Force project submitted to the EarthxHack:

https://earthxhack20.devpost.com/

It includes all the code involved in the challenge:

https://github.com/EddOliver/TreeForce

## Back end

Full IoT sensors and Particle Argon Code: https://github.com/EddOliver/TreeForce/tree/master/Particle%20Argon%20code

Node Red flow (sends the info to a dynamodb): https://github.com/EddOliver/TreeForce/tree/master/Node%20Red%20Flow


## Front End

3D printed parts:

Webpage (note that the DS file tha is outside the folder belongs to the webpage):https://github.com/EddOliver/TreeForce/tree/master/WebPage%20ReactJS

## Important 

Because it is primarily an IoT enabled device, some of the features like the notifications and sensor analytics are not possible to test remotely without fabricating your own.

Having said that, the webpage is fully operational and we are up for a Zoom test! If you are a judge, feel free to contact us and we will perform a live demo, including devices ON THE SPOT!
