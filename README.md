## Important 

Because it is primarily an IoT enabled device, some of the features like the notifications and sensor analytics are not possible to test remotely without fabricating your own.

Having said that, the webpage is fully operational and we are up for a Zoom test! If you are a judge, feel free to contact us and we will perform a live demo, including devices ON THE SPOT!
